## BikeShare  🚲

This Python/Pandas application analyzes bike share data from three major US cities (Chicago, New York City, and Washington), allowing users to filter by month and day of the week to explore patterns in travel times, popular stations, trip durations, and rider demographics. The interactive program presents various statistics about bike usage and allows users to view the raw data in manageable chunks, making it easy to understand how bike sharing services are being utilized in these cities.
